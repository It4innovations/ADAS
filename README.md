## List of open source projects

### [\[Betweenness\] Betweenness centrality](https://github.com/It4innovations/Betweenness)
C++ implementation of Betweenness algorithm according to U. Brandes: On Variants of Shortest-Path Betweenness Centrality and their Generic Computation (2008). Includes sequential and parallel versions (OpenMP and MPI).

Licensed under LGPL and ODBL. 

### [\[Chaos01\] Chaos01 R software package](https://code.it4i.cz/ADAS/Chaos01)
Computes and visualize the results of the 0-1 test for chaos proposed by Gottwald and Melbourne (2004) <DOI:10.1137/080718851>. The algorithm is available in parallel for the independent values of parameter c. Additionally,  ast RQA is added to distinguish chaos from noise.

### [\[Handicap\] Handicap scheduling](https://github.com/It4innovations/Handicap)

Scheduling of incomplete tournaments brinks the possibility of adjusting difficulty of the collection of matches played by each team.
Strong teams may meet stronger opponents and weaker teams weaker opponents. Thus each match counts and we have an attractive tournament.

The SW looks for all structures of tournaments with a given number of teams and given number of games. The output is a labeled graph that models the tournament. This are starting cases for general construction of infinite classes of handicap graphs.

### [\[HyperLoom\] HyperLoom](https://github.com/It4innovations/HyperLoom)
HyperLoom is a platform for defining and executing workflow pipelines in large-scale distributed environments.

HyperLoom implements its own schedulling algorithm optimized for execution of millions of interconnected tasks on hundreds of computational nodes. HyperLoom also includes a thin Python client module that allows to easily define and execute the pipelines on HyperLoom infrastructure.

### [\[Maui-Simulation\] Maui Simulation Setup for IT4Innovations](https://github.com/It4innovations/Maui-Simulation)
This repository contains the setup of the Maui Scheduler to simulate the job scheduling of IT4Innovations' large-scale PBS based Salomon cluster. It has been used in our paper **Job Simulation for large-scale PBS based Clusters with the Maui Scheduler** (see section [Paper and Citation](#paper-and-citation) below) and is made available to enable other PBS based computing centers to run simulations.

### [\[Middleware\] HEAppE - High-End Application Execution Middleware](https://code.it4i.cz/ADAS/HEAppE/Middleware)

### [\[PTDR\] Probabilistic Time Dependent Routing](https://github.com/It4innovations/PTDR)

Probabilistic Time-Dependent Routing implementation with integrated mArgot 2 autotuner.

Licensed under BSD 3 - Clause license.

### [\[RQA_HPC\] RQA HPC](https://code.it4i.cz/ADAS/RQA_HPC)

This project is focused at computing Recurrence Quantitative Analysis (RQA) in the HPC environment.
RQA is used to study structure and predictability of the time series data.

### [\[RobotSoccer\] Robot Soccer Simulator](https://github.com/It4innovations/RobotSoccer)
This program is intended for simulating soccer game played between two robot teams. These robots have defined behavior by tactics and strategies definitions, which defines how they should behave in certain situations in game field like positions of enemy robots, ball and playmates.

### [\[TimeSeriesComparer\] Time Series Comparer based on Dynamic Programming](https://code.it4i.cz/ADAS/TimeSeriesComparer)

This application purpose is to analyze similarity (distance) between time series. For that purpose, this application implements algorithms based on dynamic programming such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) methods. 

This application is written in C++ language and supports Windows and Linux operations systems. Part of implementation is the interface for C# language. Thanks to this, it is possible to compile this application as standalone program or library.

### [[\all\] Agora Learning Library](https://github.com/It4innovations/all)

This repository consists of two plugins for the autotuner mARGOt. These plugins are written in R and use CSV or Apache Cassandra for data storage. Plugins are made to work with mARGOt, it is possible to run the R scripts on their own, if the data are prepared according to their documentation.

### [\[mloc\] MLoC - Machine Learning on Cluster](https://github.com/It4innovations/mloc)
Machine learning as a Service solution.

Licensed under MIT license.

### [\[snailwatch\] Snailwatch](https://github.com/It4innovations/snailwatch)
This repository contains code for the continous performance monitoring service
**Snailwatch**.

Snailwatch is a database for your benchmark results that can automatically
notify you when a performance regression is detected. It also
offers a dashboard with historical trends of your app's performance.

You can find its documentation [here](https://snailwatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest).
