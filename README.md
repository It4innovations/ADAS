## List of open source projects

### [Betweenness](https://github.com/It4innovations/Betweenness)
C++ implementation of Betweenness algorithm according to U. Brandes: On Variants of Shortest-Path Betweenness Centrality and their Generic Computation (2008). Includes sequential and parallel versions (OpenMP and MPI).

Licensed under LGPL and ODBL. 

### [Snailwatch](https://github.com/It4innovations/snailwatch)
This repository contains code for the continous performance monitoring service
**Snailwatch**.

Snailwatch is a database for your benchmark results that can automatically
notify you when a performance regression is detected. It also
offers a dashboard with historical trends of your app's performance.

You can find its documentation [here](https://snailwatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

### [Maui Simulation Setup for IT4Innovations](https://github.com/It4innovations/Maui-Simulation)
This repository contains the setup of the Maui Scheduler to simulate the job scheduling of IT4Innovations' large-scale PBS based Salomon cluster. It has been used in our paper **Job Simulation for large-scale PBS based Clusters with the Maui Scheduler** (see section [Paper and Citation](#paper-and-citation) below) and is made available to enable other PBS based computing centers to run simulations.

### [Machine learning as a Service solution.](https://github.com/It4innovations/mloc)

### [urban-tep](https://github.com/It4innovations/urban-tep)

### [Time Series Comparer based on Dynamic Programming](https://code.it4i.cz/ADAS/TimeSeriesComparer)

This application purpose is to analyze similarity (distance) between time series. For that purpose, this application implements algorithms based on dynamic programming such as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) methods. 

This application is written in C++ language and supports Windows and Linux operations systems. Part of implementation is the interface for C# language. Thanks to this, it is possible to compile this application as standalone program or library.

### [RQA_HPC](https://code.it4i.cz/ADAS/RQA_HPC)

This project is focused at computing Recurrence Quantitative Analysis (RQA) in the HPC environment.
RQA is used to study structure and predictability of the time series data.

### [Chaos01 R software package](https://code.it4i.cz/ADAS/Chaos01/)

Computes and visualize the results of the 0-1 test for chaos proposed by Gottwald and Melbourne (2004) <DOI:10.1137/080718851>. The algorithm is available in parallel for the independent values of parameter c. Additionally,  ast RQA is added to distinguish chaos from noise.
